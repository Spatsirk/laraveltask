# Project Title

Laravel test task

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
WampServer or any other which allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Create lsapp folder into WampServer folder. Should look like this: C:\wamp\www\
Copy all commited files into C:\wamp\www\lsapp
Create lsapp database and import sql file into it.
If needed change database username and pw in .env file.
```

## Deployment

If the images are not showing, check if you really have everyting located in \www\lsapp folder.

## Built With

* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - The web framework used

## Authors

* **Kristaps Mudurs** - *Initial work* 

##Notes

You can see this git repository live: http://zap399732-1.plesk08.zap-webspace.com/ , but upload and edit for images does not work, because host which I used does not allow folder shortcuts, so it's there just to see frontend.
